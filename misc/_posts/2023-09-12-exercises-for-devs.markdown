# Introduction

Being a programmer might be tought as a some kiddo spending his whole life in a basement scribbling some strange stuff on his computer, that got a legs broken after going upstairs. In this post I would like to briefly write about the need of excercise and moving yourself when you are spending your days before the screen.

# My struggle

For a really long time I was perceiving the moving body as a stupid excuse of people who didn't know on which to spend their hard-earned money. Gym? Exercise? Pfff. Everything started changing when before the age 30 I started having really strong back pains - they were not frequent, happened mostly when I was put in a long-term stress (which is easily to achieve when you are buying a flat, working, finishing studies and planning marriage at the same time). Didn't really care about them, but at some point I decided to man up and face the problem. Got MRI-scan and apparently the result is simple: some of the vertebraes of my spine are rotated (not much to be operated, but they can cause tension at some situations).

Around the same time I started exercising (not really connected with that, just wanted to in shape different than a pear) and saw that since I was exercising regulary I didn't expect that pain. I told doctor about it, she just replied: "if you think the excercices are helping you, then just do it and come back if you experience regular pain again".

Now I don't remember when I experienced the pain last time - think it was around the spring. Feel a bit better - especially when I saw that I'm able to do a push-ups on a handrails - this was something that never happen (even when I was going to school and having PE, gym and pool every week).

# What I'm doing

I was doing a lot of experiments with the formula:
* First I was doing some 20-25 min set of excercises in the early morning (waking up 30 minutes before my usual time), worked for a while, but I went sick after a month and after that I didn't want to continue (think I put too much pressure on my body and immunity system didn't make it).

* Later on I wanted to excercise during the day at home, but having a little daughter around makes you to be super cautious to not hit her accidentaly. Especially she wanted to also train and was trying to copy me. I was not making any progress, but she was happy. I changed to formula, but every time she wants to do some exercises with me I'm doing it with her no matter the condition.

* At some moment I realized: I'm working from home, working as a software engineer causes a lot of times during the day when you are waiting for something/somebody. Started working out during these periods. The approach and set was changing, but at this moment I'm doing the following:
    * Few sets (4-6) of 20 push-ups or 15 push-ups if I'm doing them on the parallettes.
    * Scissors - until I think I'm done, the "done" means that my stomach hurts.
    * Dumbells curls and arnold press - sets of 10 reps, but doing only when I feel more strength that day (for example if I had a hard night with bad sleep due to daughter/other stuff I'm not doing them).

Doing this stuff three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and I'm feeling better. I'm not doing any cardio, but walking when possible.

# Diet

For my diet I'm just trying to eat less sugar and trying to eliminate products with sugar inside (which is sometimes hard, because they pack this stuff everywhere). Eating more veggies and greens, but also a lot of meat. I'm not doing any special diet, just trying to eat less sugar (the only guilty sugar that I'm doing willingly is sugar in my coffee).

# Conclusion

As a programmer you should move your body, even if you think it's not worth it, because you got a bad memories from PE classes. Just try to find something that will work for you and stick to it. I'm not saying that you should go to the gym (but if you have money and more importantly - time you definetely should to go and talk with expert people who can help you do it right). I don't say you have to look like a Greek statue (I also will probably never look like that), but human beings are not made to sit all day long. We are made to move and we should do it.

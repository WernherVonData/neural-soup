# Introduction

Many might think that the programmers are the silent types, just sitting and typing programs in basement in elvish or orkish language. In fact the professional programming projects are a big social structures with a deep network of human-to-human interactions. This was one of the lessons that I had to learn as a programmer in a company: you need to listen to others and others have to listen to you. The information between human must flow in order to make a project successful. In fact the interactions between programmers might be compared to some hive where each worker works toward the common goal which is: earn more money for the company due to the success of the project.

There are few the most common interactions that a programmer can find during the work:
- Hive interactions (between fellow programmers).
- Interspecies interactions (between non-technical people from the company).
- Alien interactions (between you and company clients).

# The Hive Communication

Depending on the size of the company your hive might vary from few people to few hundreds of programmers. If you are working on a one component that is only a part of the bigger system sooner or later (but most likely sooner) you'll end up with a task to understand other piece of the code from outside of your domain that you would like to use or maybe fork that into your component. Or maybe someone will approach you and will ask for some help with understanding your domain? Only the God knows what can happen to you. With this fellow hive programmer you will share feedback, ask questions and call for help. This will not only help you grow, but also for him. Why, you may ask? You are simply talking with each other, you are challenging ideas between yourself, which in fact makes your brain to more thinking.

And how to achieve it? I think you know the answer - start talking. In the beginning your discussions might be a little stiff, but in no time you will get along - after all you have common interest - programming.

# The Interspecies Communication

Oh boy... now it's a little harder. First thing that you need to tackle from the impression of non-technical people is that you need to show them that you are not an alien (at least you are not speaking like one), so forget about that neat class name you just came up - focus on the high level stuff of the project - they should understand it (since they are business people - they have to know the overall concepts of the product, otherwise they are just parasites feeding over company finance). Don't go into the technical details with them - 95% of them will be noding to your words, but inside they will not understand a thing (they will not admit they do not know something).

The situation turn around when you are having a business person with technical background - then the discussions can be really interesting. You can allow yourself for a bit more technical stuff - such person will definetely understand it and what is more important will ask the sacred: "how does it contribute to the business goals and strategies". By comunication you again benefit with your interspecies companion by new knowledge and experience about your project.

# The Alien Communication

The situation is also different when you are discussing with your external clients. Here you must refrain yourself from the details of your implementations at all levels - no matter if the Alien is technical or not. Your discussions should occur only on the high (best API) level. There you are able to share the feedback with the Alien's ideas and showing them why something can be done better - the best drawing board here is part of working system that the Alien can interact with.

# How to learn the communication?

There is no unified way of learning it. I would just said like with any other things - try it in practice, gather feedback and recalibrate yourself. Start with small steps - if you are junior even the demo to your team members might frighten you, but remember: your team is there to help you out and you should help them as well. When it comes to the bigger levels of communication the practice makes perfect as well - go with your seniors, see for yourself how are they talking with other species or aliens. Analyze and adapt their way of working (of course you don't need to be 1:1 as them).

# Conclusion

The programmers are not the basement types (though many of them sometimes would like to lock themselve in some little dark room with a computer and coffee). A lot of their work lies in the interactions on different levels. Be open-minded for more communication with people and it will just make you a better programmer.

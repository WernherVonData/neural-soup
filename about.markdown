I am a MSc graduate of Lodz University of Technology in Inteligent Systems and Software Engineering. Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer (or Software Engineer III in newspeak) in a Search Engine department in navigation company. Husband and father of one.

Interested mostly in programming languages as well as in writing good code overall and being pragmatic about it.

This blog is a place where I'm going to share various thougts and maybe share some different stuff that I'm learning/working on as a free-time project - I'm not working in one fields here - trying to learn various kinds of fields, because I just like it.

Apart from STEM fields I like painting miniatures, playing different kind of games and reading books (mostly science-fiction/fantasy, but I'm not picky - book must be good in a first place).
